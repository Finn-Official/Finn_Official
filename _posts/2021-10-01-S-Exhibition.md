Introduction:


Definition of HOME: 

Lighthouses, which are a symbol of the homeward journey, always give wandering sailors a firm sense of security. As a special architectural prototype, the lighthouse can give the resident a good view.  The top of the lighthouse is a unique spiritual space, the keeper of the lighthouse always looks down on the world in a condescending point, this position can give people a feeling of arrogance, also loneliness. Because the whole building is slender, the floor space of every layer is tiny and compressed, therefore, this project intends to expand the vertical flexibility and possibility.

Client: Low-income groups, Environmentalist, Hermit

Personal Interest: Minimum space, Autarkic building

Capacity: 2

Pets: 0-2

For the final version, to improve the utilization efficiency of the spaces, different essential functions are separated into different segments. Hence an integrated circle becomes scattered, the entire building will have different units adhere to a strong central column. Necessary supplementary architectural components like water storage, electric wire and other things will be exposed to emphasize the industrial nature of the whole building. In this version, this autarkic building have a central energy supply--a enormous turbine.
